## An Analysis of rainfall patterns in Oahu
We set out to analyze weather patterns in Oahu to determine the potential viability of an ice cream near the beach. We isolated temperature data from the months of December and June to determine variance between the weather conditions of both months.

### OVERVIEW


### RESULT
Here are screenshots of the summary stats:

- June

- December

As we see, the temperature in Oahu is not only reletively consistent between both months, it is also, generally speaking, very comfortable by human standards.


### SUMMARY

It seems appropriate to consider what we don't know. Our analysis doesn't indicate the rainfall totals, so we don't know if it rains all month long in December for example. That data is available to us, but we have not considered it for this analysis.

We also have no idea what might be happening during the 10 months of the year that fell outside the scope of our analysis. We can presume based on Oahu's reputation for a comfortable climate that it is stable and pleasant, but we probably don't want to make important business decisions based on assumptions, especially when it would be easy enough to refactor our code to conduct analysis on the remaining months.
